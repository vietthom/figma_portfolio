## Practice Portfolio Design from Figma

In the real world, web designers and developers work together to create stunning websites and applications. With this project, I sourced a free figma design to practice creating a fictional portfolio landing page to simulate the colaboration between designer and developer. 

You can check out the figma design here: https://www.figma.com/file/gKZoWoleFgP35xvYu83Y2l/Portfolio-UI---Web-%26-Mobile?node-id=0%3A1&t=YLbNCJxZoRkEtK7A-0
